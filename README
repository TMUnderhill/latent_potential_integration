# Latent potential: scRNA-seq, scATAC-seq integration code 

5)	A pipeline has been developed to integrate scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq datasets to enable the identification of loci with latent potential (i.e., unrealilzed transcriptional potential). This method identifies genes with limited expression (scRNA-seq), but with open chromatin (scATAC-seq). The custom scripts in this repository take as an input pre-processed scRNA-seq/scATAC-seq data in the form of a Seurat/Signac object with annotated clusters for both modalities, saved as `.RData` files.
